# Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Program - Term One
## Project One Title : Explore Weather Trends
In this project, I analyzed local and global temperature data and compared the temperature trends where I live to overall global temperature trends.

## Database schema
Given database schema has three tables, namely:
- city_list - List of cities and countries in the database. Look through them in order to find the city nearest to you.
- city_data - Average temperatures for each city by year (ºC).
- global_data - Average global temperatures by year (ºC).

## Project completion Steps
1. Written SQL query to extract city-level data and exported to CSV file.

1. Written SQL query to extract my city Philadelphia data and exported to CSV file.

1. Written SQL query to extract the global data and exported to CSV file.

1. Open CSV file using Python's Pandas Library


1. Created a line chart(Python's Seaborn Visualization Library) comparing  my city Philadelphia temperatures with the global temperatures.

1. Following observation made about the similarities and differences between the world averages and your city’s averages, as well as overall trends
	+ The city, Philadelphia/USA temperatures are rising at a higher rate in comparison to Global temperature trends.
	+ Overall trend from last few centuries show that temperatures are rising and Earth getting hotter.

## Important files and Notes
Following CSV files were used to complete the project
- weatherTrends-global_data.csv
- weatherTrends-city_data.csv
- weatherTrends-city_data_philadelphia.csv
