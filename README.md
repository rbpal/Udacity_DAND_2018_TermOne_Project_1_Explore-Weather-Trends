# Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Program - Term One
## Project One Title : Explore Weather Trends
In this project, I analyzed local and global temperature data and compared the temperature trends where I live to overall global temperature trends.


## Database schema
Given database schema has three tables, namely:
- city_list - List of cities and countries in the database. Look through them in order to find the city nearest to you.
- city_data - Average temperatures for each city by year (ºC).
- global_data - Average global temperatures by year (ºC).


## Project completion Steps
<ol>
<li>Written SQL query to extract city-level data and exported to CSV file.</li>

<li>Following observation made about the similarities and differences between the world averages and your city’s averages, as well as overall trends</li>
    <ul>
      <li>The city, Philadelphia/USA temperatures are rising at a higher rate in comparison to Global temperature trends.</li>
      <li>Overall trend from last few centuries show that temperatures are rising and Earth getting hotter.</li>
    </ul>
  </li> 
</ol>
